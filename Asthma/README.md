## ASTHMA PROJECT 

The following notebook aim to explore feasibility and benchmarks of a classifier with the library xgboost on a dataset acquired during asthma related clinical trials. 

It will need to answer 2 questions: 
- are we able (and with what accuracy) to predict the relapse of a patient?
- what are the main features used? 
  
#### The dataset: 
The dataset is the result of several data acquisition coming from a clinical trail; the dataset is preprocessed using several scripts not commited here. 

#### The notebook: 
To excute the notebook create the conda environment and follow the guide at the beginning of the notebook. 
Instead of creating a conda environment is possible to containerize the notebook as shown [here](https://github.com/momenteg/Spark) but IMHO is overkilled.
